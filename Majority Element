https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

Approach:-
In this we are changing number when it count is zero means number is changed when count of other element is greater than current element
but if answer has count greater than n/2 then in the end it would remain as it's count is greater than all other number count.

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = -1, count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (count == 0) {
                ans = nums[i];
            }
            if (nums[i] == ans)
                count++;
            else
                count--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Approach:-
when we count a character with frequence more than 1 just go in backward untill its frequency go to 1, 
decrease frequency of all the variable untill that point also, use j variable for this.
answer would be difference in current i and j take max of it.

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        unordered_map<char, int> m;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; i++) {
            m[s[i]]++;
            while (m[s[i]] > 1) {
                m[s[j]]--;
                j++;
            }
            ans = max(ans, i-j+1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

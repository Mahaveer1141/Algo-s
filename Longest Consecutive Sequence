https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/

Approach:-
Use map for constant loopup time.
check if currentNumber -1 is present in map or not if yes then move to next number
else
it means it is start of new streak then use a loop what is consecutive maximum number that is present in this map.

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        for (int i : nums)
            m[i] = 1;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            int cr = 0, cn = i;
            if (m[i-1])
                continue;
            while (m[cn]) {
                cr++;
                cn++;
            }
            ans = max(ans, cr);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

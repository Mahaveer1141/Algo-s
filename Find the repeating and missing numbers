Approach1:-
calculate sum of number and sum of squares of number
subtract it from given array's sum and sqaure sum;

let x be repeating number and y be missing number.
after subtracting we have
x^2 - y^2 and
x - y

we can calculate using maths now.

Approach2:-
calculate xor of 1 to n and array elements.
let x be repeating number and y be missing number.
we will have 
x xor y.

now check for any set bit, set bit means either x is 0 and y is 1 or vice versa.

make two set which have set bit as 1 and one set with set bit as 0
after that xor them with array element and 1 to n.
x and y would be found in any order.
